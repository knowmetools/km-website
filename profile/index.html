				KnowMe Profile is a collection of pictures and words that quickly communicate to others what you want them to know about you. It is designed for people who sometimes rely on others to speak for them. With KnowMe, you can be sure that what you want to communicate about yourself is accurately shared with people you want to talk to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Equally important, the message comes from YOU through your iPad, not through an intermediary. You have ownership of your own information.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you need help translating your voice into words that can be understood, you can invite people who know you best to collaborate on that translation, greatly increasing the chances youâ€™re interpreted correctly.  Your whole team can then work to understand your desires and teach others about your unique way of communicating.
			</p>

			<p>
				Profile is easy to edit and easy to use. With it, you can create multiple profiles for different social groups:  coaches, doctors, co-workers, teachers, friends, and more.
