        <h2>Accepting the Invite</h2>
        <p>
          To accept this invite, open the link you received in <strong>Safari on
          your iOS device</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Don't Have the App?</h2>
        <p>
          If you don't have the app yet, just click the link below and you'll be
          taken to its page in the App Store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've downloaded the app and created your account, click on the
          invitation link in the email you received and you'll be taken to the

        <h2>Came From Your Email App?</h2>
        <p>
          Some email apps have their own integrated web browser. Unfortunately
          the process to accept the invitation only works in Safari. To resolve
          this, open the link you received in Safari by tapping the &ldquo;Open
          in Safari&rdquo; button. In the Gmail app, the button looks like this:
        </p>

        <img src='{% asset_path "external_link.png" %}' alt='External Link' />

        <h2>On an Android Device?</h2>
        <p>
          We don't yet have a version of the app for Android devices, but we're
          working on it. In the meantime, accept this invite on your iPhone or
          iPad.
