			<p>
				Know Me creates tools that help people with communication disabilities connect with others and be more clearly heard. Our larger goal is to provide both them and their teams with a system of tools and support that will increase independence, improve health, and build closer relationships â€“ and ultimately a higher quality of life for both them and their teams.

						<h3>Susan Hollobaugh</h3>
						<p class="text-muted job-title">Enterprise Development</p>

						<p>
							Susan began her career as an elementary school teacher before switching to the business sector as a corporate trainer, and eventually an executive position in Human Resource Management  for General Motors.  After receiving her PhD, she left to become an independent consultant but was lured back into the corporate world by DTE Energy where she eventually became Director of Organization and Training. Her most satisfying accomplishments were being on the management team that created the "UAW/GM Human Resource Center", to prepare workers and leaders for changes driven by globalization; and creating "The Learning Zone", a high tech planning space where DTE individuals and work teams could come to prepare for deregulation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Susan has a 28 year old son with communication disabilities. Several years ago she started trying to answer the question "How can I create a sustainable solution for when I'm not around?"  The advent of mobile applications provided a solution.  Know Me has launched two apps that provide portable tools for people with communication disabilities and their caregivers.  They are truly person centered.  The information travels with individuals and they and/or their representative(s) control the information shared.
						</p>
						<p>
							Susan looks forward to collaborating with others interested in helping people with communication difficulties be known, and to learning the stories of others who seek answers to "what happens when I'm not around to 'speak' for my loved one?"

						<h3>Michelle Neumann</h3>
						<p class="text-muted job-title">Organizational Development and Client Growth</p>

						<p>
							Throughout her life, Michelle has consistently been an advocate for people with marginalized identities. In college, she reinstated and lead Active Minds, an organization focused on challenging the stigma around and increasing knowledge about mental health issues. Additionally, she has worked with the LGBTQ community in professional and personal settings, focusing her first year of her master's program on working with transgender adults in multiple capacities including facilitating a support group, providing one-on-one therapy, writing suicide protocol for the organization, and providing educational workshops to the community at large. Following that, she worked to support a community of people with severe mental health issues and other disabilities by writing grants, organizing a coalition, participating in policy advocacy, and managing various administrative tasks. 
						</p>
						<p>
							After finishing her Master of Social Work (MSW) with a focus on organizational leadership and policy practice, she excitedly joined the Know Me team in 2016. Her person-centered training, along with her passion for creating widespread systemic change, has provided her the skills necessary to manage organizational operations, development, client growth, and other diverse jobs within the company.

						<h3>Brandon Smith</h3>
						<p class="text-muted job-title">iOS Development</p>

						<p>
							Brandon has always had a love for computers and began taking computer science and web design classes in high school. He would spend his evenings in high school creating web apps and websites for bands and realized that working with technology is what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. He graduated from North Carolina State University with a degree in Computer Science. For the first several years of his career, his work focused on database and middle tier technologies. He started creating iOS applications and games in his free time and realized his love of mobile development. Brandon couldn't be happier now that he is part of the Know Me team, as it gives him the opportunity to work on a product that truly makes a difference while also focusing on the technologies he is passionate about.
