			<p>
				Know Me creates tools that help people with communication disabilities connect with others and be more clearly heard. Our larger goal is to provide both them and their teams with a system of tools and support that will increase independence, improve health, and build closer relationships – and ultimately a higher quality of life for both them and their teams.

						<h3>Susan Hollobaugh</h3>

						<p>
							Susan&rsquo;s interest has always been in education and training, from her time as a school teacher to her work at General Motors and DTE Energy. This experience came in handy when her son was born with multiple special needs. It led to the development of several &ldquo;tools&rdquo; to help him be known, which grew into an unruly pile of notebooks and charts, and finally to the development of Know Me. When she&rsquo;s not working, you’ll find Susan playing in the dirt or protecting trees.

						<h3>Brandon Smith</h3>

						<p>
							Brandon is a NC State graduate who studied Computer Science and has been with the development team since late last Fall.  He&rsquo;s always enjoyed web design and programming, but when he isn&rsquo;t coding, you can find him playing the drums, camping with friends and family, and trying new craft beers. He also makes the best cup of coffee in the whole office. Hot too.
