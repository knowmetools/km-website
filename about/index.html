						Susan’s roots are in Detroit, Michigan. She worked as a teacher, an HR manager in the auto and energy industries, and an independent consultant before moving to Chapel Hill in 2004. She founded Know Me in 2013, inspired by both her work with her son Alex and her work on behalf of others who have trouble communicating their full personhood. She says, “When Alex was in middle school, I realized that I had to know him better if we were to assure a good life for him. It was the beginning of a journey that led to so many discoveries. I was increasingly aware that there were lots of people struggling with the same issue and that we needed a sustainable plan for when I wasn’t around.”

						Susan loves puzzles and problem solving, and for her this work is the ultimate puzzle. “This is about giving people the tools they need to understand those who aren’t easily understood,” she says. “Alex has a dimension that is hard to put into words it’s so extraordinary.  People that get close to him tend to treasure the relationship. This population can give us so much, if we just know how receive it.” Susan is happy to be part of the team working on solutions for this puzzle.

					<p class="card-text">
						Brian hails from Cleveland, Ohio and landed in Chapel Hill in part because of a hedgehog named Desmond. After working for Facebook and Twitter, he joined the Know Me team in 2013. Brian studied math and economics at Pomona College and now uses these skills to develop and manage all of the technical components at Know Me. He teaches improv classes at the DSI Comedy Theater in his spare time, and once skateboarded all the way to Florida. One day, he hopes to own a tiny food truck that sells miniature foods. “So much of life is serious and unchangeable,” he says.  “Having a lighthearted sense of humor is a necessary counter to all that. It helps you be a real person.”
