			<p>
				Know Me creates tools that help people with communication disabilities connect with others and be more clearly heard. Our larger goal is to provide both them and their teams with a system of tools and support that will increase independence, improve health, and build closer relationships – and ultimately a higher quality of life for both them and their teams.

						<h3>Susan Hollobaugh</h3>
						<p class="text-muted job-title">CEO</p>

						<p>
							Susan’s roots are in Detroit. She was a teacher, an HR manager and consultant before founding Know Me, inspired by her son Alex and others who have trouble communicating their full personhood. “At some point I realized that I needed to know him better and to help others know him when I’m not around...and that any solutions had to be fairly easy and sustainable.” Her journey taught her the many reasons people can fail to be known; but also that there are a lot of good and wise people out there creating. Finding solutions. “This is about giving people the tools they need to understand those who aren’t easily understood,” she says. “Alex has a dimension that is hard to put into words it’s so extraordinary. People that get close to him tend to treasure the relationship. This population can give us so much, if we just know how receive it.” Susan is happy to be part of the team working on solutions for this puzzle.

						<h3>Brian Sutorius</h3>
						<p class="text-muted job-title">Technical Lead</p>

						<p>
							Brian hails from Cleveland, Ohio and landed in Chapel Hill in part because of a hedgehog named Desmond. After working for Facebook and Twitter, he joined the Know Me team in 2013. Brian studied math and economics at Pomona College and now uses these skills to develop and manage all of the technical components at Know Me. He teaches improv classes at the DSI Comedy Theater in his spare time, and once skateboarded all the way to Florida. One day, he hopes to own a tiny food truck that sells miniature foods. “So much of life is serious and unchangeable,” he says. “Having a lighthearted sense of humor is a necessary counter to all that. It helps you be a real person.”
