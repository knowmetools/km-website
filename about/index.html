				Know Me creates tools that help people with communication disabilities connect with others and be more clearly heard. Our larger goal is to provide both them and their teams with a system of tools and support that will increase independence, improve health, and build closer relationships – and ultimately a higher quality of life for both them and their teams.

						<h3>Susan Hollobaugh</h3>
						<p class="text-muted job-title">Enterprise Development</p>

						<p>
							Susan’s roots are in Detroit. She was a teacher, an HR manager, and consultant before founding Know Me, inspired by her son Alex and others who have trouble communicating their full personhood. She says, “At some point I realized that the most important thing I could do was learn how to know Alex better and help others know him when I’m not around. I knew any solutions had to be fairly easy to implement and sustainable.” Susan loves a good puzzle and says this has been the most intriguing and challenging one. She looks forward to collaborating with others who are working on its solutions.
