				The Friends app visually organizes the people in your life by group: family, friends, colleagues, teammates, classmates, and so on. You determine the categories. In early testing we found many unexpected uses for this seemingly simple app and expect to discover more. These are just a few uses:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Hear a personal message from someone in your life whenever you want, even when they are far away or busy.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Introduce your friends from one group with those from another.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Share information regarding how you relate to a variety of people.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Use as a name and face memorization tool for yourself and your team.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				To use Friends, simply record video messages from your favorite people with your ipad or have them send you a recorded message. Arrange your recordings into groups you create.
