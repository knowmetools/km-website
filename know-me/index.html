				Know Me is an integrated set of tools to help you express who you are to the people in your life. Its main feature is Profile, supported by Gallery and Team Talk.
			</p>

			<p>
				Know Me Profile is a collection of pictures and words that quickly communicate to others what you want them to know about you. It is designed for people who sometimes rely on others to speak for them. With Know Me, you can be sure that what you want to communicate about yourself is accurately shared with people you want to talk to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Profile is easy to edit and easy to use. You can create multiple profiles for different social groups: coaches, doctors, co-workers, teachers, friends, and more. Equally important, the message comes from YOU through your iPad, not through an intermediary. You have ownership of your own information.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you need help translating your voice into words that can be understood, you can invite people who know you best to collaborate on that translation through Team Talk, greatly increasing the chances youâ€™re interpreted correctly. Your whole team can then work to understand your desires and teach others about your unique way of communicating.
			</p>

			<p>
				Store documents and media that convey greater detail about you in the Gallery. Upload photos and videos, link to your favorite websites, and attach PDFs from your Dropbox account. This way, the Know Me app helps you express who you are at any level of detail.
